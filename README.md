# Gnomic

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/gnomic-grammar.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/gnomic-grammar)

Gnomic is a grammar for describing genotypes and phenotypes of microbial strains. It is designed to provide an unambiguous, human and machine readable genotype definition notation with flexibility in the level of detail of the definition. The `gnomic-grammar` NodeJS package contains methods for parsing and analysis of genotype definitions written in gnomic. 

## Installation

Install the `gnomic-grammar` package via NPM:

    npm install gnomic-grammar

## Grammar

The grammar consists of a *space-* or *comma-*separated list of genotype or phenotype designations described using the following nomenclature:

Designation                                 | Grammar expression
------------------------------------------- | -------------------------
`feature` deleted                              | ``-feature``
`feature` inserted                             | ``+feature``
`feature` inserted at `site`                   | ``+site::feature``
`site` replaced with `feature`                 | ``site>feature``
multiple integration `site` replaced with `feature` | ``site>>feature``
`feature` of `organism`                        | ``organism/feature``
`feature` with mutation designation            | ``feature(mutation-designation)``
`feature` with accession number                | ``feature#GB:123456``
`feature` from accession number                | ``#GB:123456``
fusion of `feature1` and `feature2`         | ``feature1:feature2``
`fusion` inserted at `site` using `marker`   | ``site::fusion::marker+``
phenotype: wild-type                      | ``phene+`` or ``phene(wild-type)``
phenotype: mutant                         | ``phene-`` or ``phene`` or ``phene(mutant)``
selection marker: used (wild-type)         | ``marker+``
selection marker: available (missing/mutant) | ``marker-``
a non-integrated plasmid | ``plasmid{}`` or ``plasmid{feature, [...]}``
plasmid with selection marker | ``plasmid{feature, [...]}::marker+``
integrated vector/plasmid with mandatory integration site | ``site>vector{feature, [...]}``
nucleotide range of a `feature` | ``feature[startBase_endBase]``
coding nucleotide range of a `gene` | ``gene[c.startBase_endBase]``
protein amino-acid range of a `gene` | ``gene[p.startAA_endAA]``
protein amino-acid of a `gene` | ``gene[p.AA]``
`feature` of type promoter | ``promoter.promoterName``

### Term definitions

Term           | Description
-------------- | --------------
``gene``       | a ``feature`` that is a gene
``feature``    | a named DNA sequence such as a gene, promoter, or terminator
``site``      | a ``feature`` (such as a ``gene``) with a specific location inside the genome of the original strain
``phene``      | an identifier for a ``feature`` that comes with a variant definition.
``marker``     | a phenotype important for its role as a selection marker
